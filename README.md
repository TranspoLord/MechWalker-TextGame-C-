# MechWalker-TextGame-C-
Redoing my python based mech walker text game. Doing it as a fun side project
The code is very basic and rudimentary. It doesn't run well aside from in code testing. 

My plan is to have the game run checks on loaded bunker configs to make sure nothing is wrong, including room placements. 
The plan is to, also, have the game save and load via text file. Save and load a room config via text file, create individual unique IDs for
each object in the game (room, enemy, item) and a unique combat system, similar to Undertale but less mental thought and more mek vs moster action.

Again, do NOT take the code that is currently written as perm
